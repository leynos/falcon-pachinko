# Developer Guide

This guide captures maintainer-facing conventions that are not part of the
public user guide.

## Spelling policy

Run the spelling gate with:

```bash
make spelling
```

The tracked `typos.toml` is regenerated on every run from the live shared
dictionary and the repository-specific `typos.local.toml` overlay. Never edit
generated entries by hand; add only narrow repository terminology to the
overlay. Because the dictionary is live, `typos.toml` must never be drift
checked in continuous integration.

The shared `typos-config-builder` CLI refreshes the estate dictionary into an
untracked local cache only when the authoritative copy is newer. A valid cache
remains usable when the network is unavailable. Quoted APIs and identifiers
retain their upstream spelling; put them in backticks or fenced code blocks
where practical rather than adding broad word-level exceptions.

## Router Request Boundary

`WebSocketRouter` is mounted as a Falcon resource, but its internal dispatch
pipeline only needs a small request surface before handing control to resource
callbacks:

- `path`: the concrete request path used for route matching.
- `path_template`: the Falcon mount template used to verify that the request
  belongs to the mounted router prefix.

The router models that surface with the private `_RequestLike` protocol in
`falcon_pachinko/router.py`. Internal routing helpers should accept
`_RequestLike` instead of broad `object` parameters. This keeps request-shaped
test doubles type-checkable while documenting the attributes the router
actually consumes.

Keep casts to `falcon.Request` at the edge where the router calls APIs whose
public contract is Falcon-specific, such as hook notification and
`WebSocketResource.on_connect()`. Do not widen the whole router pipeline back to
`falcon.Request` unless those internals start depending on Falcon-only
attributes.

Test request doubles should expose both `path` and `path_template`. Use an empty
`path_template` for root-mounted router tests, matching the runtime default
used by Falcon-style request objects that do not provide a template.

## Build Environment

The `build` target owns the local virtual environment. It depends on the
`.venv` target, which runs:

```sh
uv venv --clear
```

This deliberately replaces an existing `.venv` before `uv sync --group dev`.
The behaviour matches CI, where a previous step may already have created the
directory. Without `--clear`, modern `uv` exits with an error when `.venv`
exists, causing downstream gates such as `make typecheck` to fail before they
reach analysis.

Prefer Makefile targets over invoking tools directly. When changing the
Makefile, run `mbake validate Makefile` and the relevant commit gates before
committing.

## GitHub Actions runner placement

Repository-owned Linux lanes run on Ubicloud managed runners. Scheduled,
dispatch-only and `pull_request_target` work stays GitHub-hosted, where
public-repository minutes are free and where this migration has nothing to gain.

| Job                                   | Trigger            | Ceiling |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------ | ------- |
| `ci.yml` `lint-test`                  | pull request, push | 15 min  |
| `coverage-main.yml` `coverage-upload` | push to `main`     | 15 min  |
| `release.yml` `pure-wheel`            | tag push           | 30 min  |
| `release.yml` `release`               | tag push           | 30 min  |

*Table: the lanes that run on Ubicloud.*

Everything else stays GitHub-hosted. `build-wheels.yml`'s `build` is a
`workflow_call` matrix across Ubuntu, Windows and macOS, including aarch64
under emulation, and Ubicloud offers Linux only. `delayed-pr-comment.yml`'s
`delay_and_comment` and `get-codescene-sha.yml`'s `refresh-sha` are
dispatch-only. `dependabot-automerge.yml`'s `automerge` calls a reusable
workflow and declares no runner of its own.

### The pull-request lane's label is an expression

A pull request from a fork cannot obtain an Ubicloud runner. `lint-test` serves
pull requests, so a fixed `ubicloud-standard-2` would leave such a pull request
queueing for a runner that never arrives. It resolves its label from the head
repository instead:

```yaml
runs-on: >-
  ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.repo.fork
  && 'ubuntu-latest' || 'ubicloud-standard-2' }}
```

Every other event, `push` to `main` included, leaves the fork field null and
reaches Ubicloud. Two rules follow, and a green run demonstrates neither:

- Keep the continuation at the same indent as the first line. A continuation
  indented one level deeper keeps its line break, so the folded scalar parses
  to a label with a newline inside the expression. The document still parses,
  `actionlint` still passes, and GitHub evaluates the newline-bearing
  expression anyway.
- Do not copy the expression onto the other three lanes. They trigger on a
  push or a tag, where `github.event.pull_request` is null, so the guard could
  never hold. A guard that cannot hold reads as protection and is not.

### Ceilings

An Ubicloud runner registers as a just-in-time self-hosted runner, so GitHub's
six-hour cap does not apply and an unbounded lane can run to the five-day
limit. Every lane that can reach Ubicloud therefore declares `timeout-minutes`.

The two measured ceilings are sized from real runs rather than chosen:

| Run                               | Job               | Queue | Run time |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------- | ----- | -------- |
| CI, pull request, 2026-09-17      | `lint-test`       | 2 s   | 36 s     |
| CI, push, 2026-09-16              | `lint-test`       | 3 s   | 19 s     |
| Coverage (main), push, 2026-09-16 | `coverage-upload` | 3 s   | 34 s     |
| Coverage (main), push, 2026-08-13 | `coverage-upload` | 588 s | 30 s     |

*Table: the runs the ceilings are sized from.*

Fifteen minutes is roughly twenty-five times the longest of these, which leaves
room for a cold cache and for Ubicloud's two vCPUs. The release lanes have no
recorded run at all, so their thirty minutes is not measured; it is set wide on
the principle that a release killed part-way is worse than one that runs long.
Re-size on the third Ubicloud run of each lane.

The second coverage sample is the reason this repository is worth moving at
all. Its 588 s queue against a 30 s run is the queueing the migration targets;
the 19 s and 36 s lanes will be dominated by runner start-up either way.

### Contracts

`tests/workflow_contracts/` holds the rules above, and
`make test-workflow-contracts` runs them on their own. `make test` collects
them too, which is what makes them a gate rather than a convenience.

The registry in `.github/actionlint.yaml` is held to an equality with the
labels actually in use, in both directions. A subset assertion would miss a
registration that outlived its last use, which reads as a provider still in
play. The exemption is a named set of GitHub-hosted labels rather than a
provider prefix: a prefix rule would silently exempt a second paid provider's
labels, which is the question the registry exists to ask.

Two contracts read the `on:` block rather than the jobs, because the placement
rules rest on claims about events: that a fork can reach `lint-test`, and that
no fork can reach the other three. A contract reading only `runs-on` asserts
the consequence and never the premise, so a silent change to a trigger would
leave the consequence looking deliberate. Those contracts read the trigger
block under the boolean key `True`, because YAML 1.1 parses the bare word `on`
that way; a contract reading the string `"on"` finds nothing and passes on an
empty mapping, which is itself asserted.
